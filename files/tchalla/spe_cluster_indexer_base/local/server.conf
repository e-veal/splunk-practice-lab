# In distributed environments, it's common to have a lone search head acting
# as the license master as well. In this configuration, providing the URI
# of the license master is easiest within the indexer_base configuration.
# In the event that there are multiple search heads, you could instead use
# the org_full_license_server app, shipped to the non-license SH, as well
# as all of the indexers. In either event, the settings are the same.
